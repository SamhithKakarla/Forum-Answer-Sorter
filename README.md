# Forum-Answer-Sorter
A program that utilizes multiple string analysis techniques to sort answers in a forum best or most relavant to the question, to worst or most irrelavant, moving the best answers to the top of the forum so that readers could immediately view the most helpful answers to their questions rather than having to sort through multiple unhelpful answers themselves.
